It’s not so much that they employ a consistent, repeatable process that leads to consistent creative results. It’s more like a workshop with a set of tools and strategies for examining things deeply, for exploring new ideas, for performing experiments and testing hypotheses, to generate new and surprising insights and results.We have collected the best of these practices wherever we could find them, with a special focus on Silicon Valley, innovative companies, and the information revolution.",

Whether an idea eventually fails or succeeds, prototyping can help policy-makers, researchers, and others to make the idea more real before investing heavily in it. It helps us sketch, in low-risk and low-resource ways, how a new policy might work. Ideally, it can ‘fail-forward’ or point to better ways to pilot it more robustly. The focus is not on the final outcome (the success or failure), but on the path and its learnings.",

Metrics are popular because they allow people to use measures to make rules — and these rules can often be pretty effective. Systems change in response to incentives, and good metrics let us make rules that create the right incentives to improve.\"",

Design thinking also errs in universally privileging one particular policy style over others, and fails to account for the reality of policy mixes. Despite these deficiencies, it is argued that design thinking can inform and enrich governance by helping policy designers produce more adaptable designs, better appreciate the behavioral dynamics of public sector design, and leverage networked approaches to social problem solving.",

Social collaboration tools are being rolled out daily, yet are struggling to deliver on the promise of seamless cross-organisational collaboration. Poor adoption. Confusion. Change stress. Uncertainty. These are just some of the challenges that come with the proliferation of social collaboration tools and their expansive feature sets. To find answers we need to look past the tools. We need to understand that tools don’t switch on collaboration, people do. We need to change the conversation from ‘collaboration tools’ to collaborative people.",
