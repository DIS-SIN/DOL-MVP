Whether an idea eventually fails or succeeds, prototyping can help policy-makers, researchers, and others to make the idea more real before investing heavily in it. It helps us sketch, in low-risk and low-resource ways, how a new policy might work. Ideally, it can ‘fail-forward’ or point to better ways to pilot it more robustly. The focus is not on the final outcome (the success or failure), but on the path and its learnings.",
